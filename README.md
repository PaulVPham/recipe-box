# RECIPE BOX

I can post recipes with pictures, descriptions, ingredients, and directions!

This is still a work in progress. I have some errors to address with the ingredients list.
Manual debugging at this point. 

One of the project's main purpose was to be able to read Ruby better. I used ERB for the views.
Additionally dealt with some new Ruby gems such as one that allows for pictures to be uploaded.
